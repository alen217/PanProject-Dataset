# PanProject-Dataset

This repository contains a categorized image dataset focused on different levels of wear. The images are organized into four main folders:

- **[Minor_Wear](https://github.com/alen217/PanProject-Dataset/tree/master/Minor_Wear):** Contains numerous images representing objects with minor wear.
- **[Moderate_Wear](https://github.com/alen217/PanProject-Dataset/tree/master/Moderate_Wear):** (Contents not listed due to access issue, but presumed to contain images of moderate wear.)
- **[New_No_Wear](https://github.com/alen217/PanProject-Dataset/tree/master/New_No_Wear):** Images of new objects or those with no wear, including synthetic/generated images and real photos.
- **[Severe_Wear](https://github.com/alen217/PanProject-Dataset/tree/master/Severe_Wear):** (Contents not listed due to access issue, but presumed to contain images of severe wear.)

## Most Images Are AI-Generated

> **Note:** Most images in this dataset are generated using **Gemini AI**, ensuring a high degree of variety and control over wear types. Some real photos are also included for comparison and validation.

## Example Files

- **Minor_Wear:** Includes images such as [Minute 1.1.jpg](https://github.com/alen217/PanProject-Dataset/blob/master/Minor_Wear/Minute%201.1.jpg), [Minute 1.3.jpg](https://github.com/alen217/PanProject-Dataset/blob/master/Minor_Wear/Minute%201.3.jpg), and various PNGs like [unnamed (1).png](https://github.com/alen217/PanProject-Dataset/blob/master/Minor_Wear/unnamed%20(1).png).
- **New_No_Wear:** Contains images like [Gemini_Generated_Image_5t213g5t213g5t21.png](https://github.com/alen217/PanProject-Dataset/blob/master/New_No_Wear/Gemini_Generated_Image_5t213g5t213g5t21.png) and a variety of photos named `download (x).jpg` and `images (x).jpg`.
